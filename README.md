ML Project – Behavioral Analysis of Depression and Anxiety

Description:
This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze behavioral patterns related to depression and anxiety. The model processes input features and predicts whether the behavior indicates possible depression or anxiety risk.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

Dataset:
A behavioral dataset containing features related to user responses and activity patterns was used for training and testing the model.

How to Run:
1. Install required packages:
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

2. Run the main program:
   python main.py

Output:
The model classifies the input behavior into categories such as normal, depression risk, or anxiety risk and displays the prediction results.

Note:
This project is for academic and learning purposes only and is not intended for medical diagnosis.
